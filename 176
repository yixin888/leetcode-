176. Second Highest Salary
SQL Schema
Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the Employee table.

+----+--------+
| Id | Salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return 200 as the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the query should return null.

+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+

题目:
找出第二高的工作
这里只有一个table

思路：
1.SELECT
2.FROM
这个顺序不能错，后面别忘记分号“；”
max可以找到最高，第二高，小于它就行

SELECT max(Salary) as SecondHighestSalary
FROM Employee
WHERE Salary < (SELECT max(Salary)
               From Employee);
