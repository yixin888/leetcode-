455. Assign Cookies分配饼干
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.

Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; 
and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. 
Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

题目分析：
分配饼干
1.给你的孩子一些饼干，但是每个孩子最多给一个饼干
2.每个孩子（用i表示 ）都有自己不同程度的贪心或者满足感（用g来表示）
3.用最小的和最少的饼干来满足孩子们
4.每个饼干都有它自己的size尺寸 s 
5






Example 1:

Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.
Example 2:

Input: g = [1,2], s = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
 

Constraints:

1 <= g.length <= 3 * 104
0 <= s.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= g[i], s[j] <= 231 - 1

答案：   （java 的写法）
class Solution {
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) {
        if (s.length == 0) return 0;
        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);
        
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        int childrenContent = 0;
        
        while (i< g.length && j < s.length){
            if (g[i] <= s[j]){
                i++;
                j++;
                childrenContent++;
            }
        else{
            j++;
        }
    }
return childrenContent;
    }
}
