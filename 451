451. Sort Characters By Frequency
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

题目分析：
给出一个字符串， 给它排序，根据字母出现的频率以高到低排序


Example 1:

Input:
"tree"

Output:
"eert"

Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
Example 2:

Input:
"cccaaa"

Output:
"cccaaa"

Explanation:
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
Example 3:

Input:
"Aabb"

Output:
"bbAa"

Explanation:
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.


答案：（用python的写法）
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:           名字，第一个单词小写，第2个单词的第一个字母大写            
        string = ""                                            假设string 等于“”空的
        for key, count in Counter(s).most_common():        for loop 循环，计算频率最多的那个单词
            string += key*count                              string 空的 一个一个地加上count的最多的那个key到最少的那个
            
        return string                                      输出string
